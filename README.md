TUPLES

TUPLE- Is a collection of data that is similar to a list and uses parentheses ( () )

WHEN TO USE TUPLES.

1. When you want to maintain a set of things that you don't want to change later.
2. They are frequently used when you need to make sure particular information is not accidentally modified.
3. When you want a function to return more than one value.

PROPERTIES.

1. Tuples are ordered. They maintain the element's order unchanged.
2. Tuples are immutable.One cannot change the elements in a tuple
3. Tuples allows duplicates.They allow values that are identical.

ADVANTAGES.

1. Use less space as compared to lists.
2. They cannot be accidentally modified.
3. Faster to execute.

DISADVANTAGES.

1. Although we can add elements to lists, we are unable to add elements to tuples.
2. Tuples cannot be sorted; however, lists can be sorted by using the "list.sort()" function.
3. Tuples cannot have elements removed, whereas lists allow for element removal.
4. A value in a list can be replaced, but not in a tuple.
